1.[Introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/01_introduction.ipynb)

2.[Introduction to Graphs](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/02_graph_theory.ipynb): This tutorial provides an introduction to the fundamentals of graph theory This section provides the basics of graph theory necessary to understand this tutorial. A brief explanation of what graphs are and why graph theory is useful. If you are already familiar with graph theory, please continue to the next chapter.

3.[Graphs and combinatorial explosion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/03_graph_and_combinatorial_ explosion.ipynb): When solving graph problems, one often has to deal with subgraphs that exist exponentially. This chapter describes such combinatorial explosion.

4.[Let's touch Graphillion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/04_graphillion_first_ step.ipynb): This is the time to explain Graphillion. Using the famous "Counting Sisters Problem," we will show an example of graph set processing using Graphillion.

5.[Inside Graphillion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/05_graphillion_and_zdd. ipynb): Graphillion uses a data structure called ZDDs, and although Graphillion can be used without being aware of ZDDs, understanding ZDDs is essential to understanding Graphillion's behavior. This chapter explains the role of ZDDs in Graphillion. 6.

6.[GraphSet](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/06_graph_set.ipynb): In Graphillion can create an object called GraphSet, which represents a set of graphs, and perform various operations on it. This chapter introduces typical operations on GraphSets.

7.[Optimization with Graphillion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/07_answering_path_query.ipynb): Graphillion can be used to solve optimization problems related to graphs. This chapter explains how to solve optimization problems using Graphillion and the types of optimization problems in which Graphillion excels.

8.[Computing Network Reliability](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/08_network_reliability.ipynb ): Utilizing Graphillion's functionality, you will be able to determine the network's resilience to failure.

9.[Graphillion Practical Guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yurahuna/graphillion_tutorial/blob/master/ja/09_practical_guide.ipynb ) Some guidelines for solving problems efficiently with Graphillion.
