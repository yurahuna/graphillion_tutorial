As a typical example, ZDDs are capable of efficiently counting up the number of elements contained in a graph, as in the case of Graphillion, where the number of subgraphs contained in a `gs` can be computed by performing `len(gs)` on a `GraphSet` object `gs`. ZDD is also utilized in this calculation.\n",
